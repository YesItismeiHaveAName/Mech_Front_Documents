Hey Folks!

My name is CJT and I LOVE MTG. 
But since it took many turns I really didn't like that much,
and I want to live out my creative sides and try my best to create something myself
Mech Front is another attempt at creating a small scale Card Game that tries to create a 
unique experience and a game that is fun, competitive and replayable. 

It might fail miserably!

But that's the great part about it!

~Enjoy the ride, with ups and downs!
